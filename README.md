# Design Patterns and Satellite Communication System

This repository contains two main exercises showcasing various design patterns implemented in Java and a satellite communication system solution for problem statement no. 6.


## Exercise 1: Design Patterns in Java

### 1. Behavioural Pattern
This folder contains two use cases demonstrating the *Behavioural Design Patterns* in Java, which focus on communication between objects.

- *Use Case 1*: [MoodResponsiveHome.java](./Exercise1/BehaviouralPattern/MoodResponsiveHome.java)
- *Use Case 2*: [TimeTravelingDebugger.java](./Exercise1/BehaviouralPattern/TimeTravelingDebugger.java)

### 2. Creational Pattern
This folder contains two use cases demonstrating the *Creational Design Patterns* in Java, which deal with object creation mechanisms.

- *Use Case 1*: [SpaceMissionPlanner.java](./Exercise1/creational-pattern/SpaceMissionPlanner.java)
- *Use Case 2*: [VirtualPetSimulator.java](./Exercise1/creational-pattern/VirtualPetSimulator.java)

### 3. Structural Pattern
This folder contains two use cases demonstrating the *Structural Design Patterns* in Java, which deal with object composition and relationships.

- *Use Case 1*: [FractalArtGenerator.java](./exercise-1/structural-pattern/FractalArtGenerator.java)
- *Use Case 2*: [CoffeeShop.java](./exercise-1/structural-pattern/CoffeeShop.java)

## Exercise 2: Satellite Communication System

The second exercise includes an implementation of a *Satellite Command System* in Java. This file addresses *Problem Statement No. 6* from the problem set.

- *Satellite Command System Code*: [SatelliteCommandSystem.java](./exercise-2/SatelliteCommandSystem.java)
- *Problem Statement*: [ProblemStatement6.md](./Exercise2/ProblemStatement6.md)

## How to Run

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git

   cd Exercise1/BehaviouralPattern
   javac MoodResponsiveHome.java
   java MoodResponsive

   For the satellite communication system, navigate to the exercise-2 folder and execute:
   cd Exercise2
   javac SatelliteCommandSystem.java
   java SatelliteCommandSystem
